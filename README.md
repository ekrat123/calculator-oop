## Credits

This calculator app was inspired by the [Web Dev Simplified YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j59qQ7YWLxw). I watched the tutorial and then implemented the code as an exercise in object-oriented programming.

Feel free to contribute to this project or use it as a learning resource for understanding OOP in JavaScript.
